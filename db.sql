It&#39;s also important from the job perspective because Robots and Bots are getting smarter day by day, thanks to these technologies and most likely will take over some of the jobs which many programmers do today.

This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users.

Next, they introduce the &ldquo;deployment pipeline,&rdquo; an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release.

Although it has never been clearly formulated, a philosophy has developed as an undercurrent in the object community, which I call &quot;domain-driven design&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have spent the past decade focused on developing complex systems in several business and technical domains. I&#39;ve tried best practices in design and development process as they have emerged from the leaders in the object-oriented development community. Some of my projects were very successful; a few failed. A feature common to the successes was a rich domain model that evolved through iterations of design and became part of the fabric of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book provides a framework for making design decisions and a technical vocabulary for discussing domain design. It is a synthesis of widely accepted best practices along with my own insights and experiences.

Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called &ldquo;Divide-and-Conquer&rdquo;), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition.

Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.&quot;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/38Eb9yO\">Amazon.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2P37DWJ\">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> by Michael Feathers (26.4% recommended)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---9YagzAR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/8.jpg%23center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---9YagzAR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.daolf.com/images/programming_book_list/8.jpg%23center\" /></a><br />\r\n&quot;In this book, Michael Feathers offers start-to-finish strategies for working more effectively with large, untested legacy code bases.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.
